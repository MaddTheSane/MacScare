MAC SCARE 1.3.3 - SOURCE CODE
-----------------------------

WHAT IS IT?
MacScare is an clone of ADRIFT Runner for MacOS X. You can use MacScare to run Interactive Fiction (Text Adventures) created with ADRIFT on your Mac.

SOURCE CODE ???
If you just want to play Adrift games, get the built executables, MacScare-GUI, or the command-line tools, MacScare-CLI.

WHY DOESN'T IT PLAY GAME X?
MacScare should be able to play any ADRIFT games created using ADRIFT 3.8 and later. If a game doesn't work, it very likely is either an even older game, or it uses the ADRIFT battle system, which is also unsupported.

BUILDING THE MAC VERSION
xCode project files are included. They pretty much just compile Scare and Glk together into an application and add the Credits.rtf file and the icons. The Unix scare source files themselves are not included, you need to obtain them separately, e.g. from http://www.ifarchive.org.

LICENSE
MacScare is subject to the GNU GPL. See the "Copying" file in this folder for the license.

AUTHORS
Simon Baldwin and Mark J. Tilford - Scare (for Unix etc.)
Andrew Hunter - CocoaGlk (the GUI library used to display the actual games)
M. Uli Kusterer - MacScare, modifications to CocoaGlk, Icon.
